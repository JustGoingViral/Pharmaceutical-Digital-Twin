"""Quantum scenario simulation utilities.

This module originally depended on :mod:`qiskit` for quantum circuit
simulation.  The test environment used for this kata does not provide a full
qiskit installation, so importing it would raise an ``ImportError`` during
test collection.  To keep the public API stable while avoiding a hard
dependency on qiskit, the import is now optional with a lightweight numpy
based fallback.  When qiskit is available the original behaviour is preserved;
otherwise ``run_simulation`` returns pseudoâ€‘random counts that mimic the shape
of qiskit's output.  This allows unit tests to execute in minimal
environments without compiling heavy scientific dependencies.
